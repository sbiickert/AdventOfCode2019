# AdventOfCode2019

Better late than never

## Purpose

I am going to try to work through the 2019 Advent of Code (https://adventofcode.com/2019) in Python, using Pythonista (http://omz-software.com/pythonista/) on my iPad Air 4 with Magic Keyboard.

## Thoughts 3 Days In

This rocks. I've used an iPad daily for more than seven years, but until now I never coded on it. It's something I never knew was missing until it was there. Pythonista is not perfect. So far, my main gripes are:

- Cursor support does not include iPadOS 14 capabilities. Text selection with the trackpad is bad. But I hope that's coming.
- No built-in GitHub support. I post my code after every part, and at the moment I am running to my MacBook to use GitHub Desktop.

But other than that, I really can't complain. Debugging works like I expect, running in the console works like a charm. So far, every "import" that I've tried has worked. I know you can't add arbitrary Python libraries with pip or conda, but I'm okay with this for now. I've got autocomplete that works well. Don't tell my wife, but I think I might have found the iPad use case that makes me regret not getting the big iPad Pro.

My thought on using Python: I think I'm going to be using "typing" from here on out. Already I've had a few type issues where I thought a value was an int and it was still a string. I like relying on the computer to help me out with such things.
